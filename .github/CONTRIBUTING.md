# Contributing Guide for audit-export

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for considering contributing to the audit-export project! ðŸŒŸ We appreciate your efforts and support. Please follow the guidelines below to contribute effectively. ðŸš€

## Local Testing

To test the project locally, you use one of the test audits as input to this script, as shown below:

1. To test with a NodeJS v16+ audit:
```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/npm-audit-v16.json | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

2. To test with a NodeJS v10 to v15 audits:
```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/npm-audit-v10.json | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

## Node.js Version Compatibility

The tool is designed to work with different versions of Node.js. Specifically:

- For Node.js v10 to v14.
- For Node.js v16 and higher.

<sub>odd versions aren't listed, but also works.</sub>

So make sure to test the tool in both version ranges to ensure compatibility. ðŸ”„
