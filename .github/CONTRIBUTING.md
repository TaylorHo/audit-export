## Local Testing

To test the project locally, you use one of the test audits as input to this script, as shown below:

1. To test with a NodeJS v16+ audit:

```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/npm-audit-node-v16.json | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

2. To test with a NodeJS v10 to v15 audits:

```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/npm-audit-node-v10.json | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

3. To test with pnpm audits:

```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/pnpm-audit-v10.json | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

4. To test with yarn audits:

```bash
cat .playwright/fixtures/yarn-audit.jsonl | node ./src/index.js <parameters>
```

5. To test with bun audits:

```bash

## Node.js Version Compatibility

The tool is designed to work with different versions of Node.js. Specifically:

- For Node.js v10 to v14.
- For Node.js v16 and higher.

<sub>It also works with <code>npm</code>, <code>pnpm</code>, <code>yarn</code> and <code>bun</code></sub><br/>
<sub>Odd versions aren't listed, but also works.</sub>

So make sure to test the tool in both version ranges and tools to ensure compatibility. ðŸ”„
